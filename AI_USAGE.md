# AI Usage Log
This log summarizes where and how generative AI tools were used in this project. The log is organized the same way as the rest of the repository for consistency. Any file not mentioned below was either fully done by hand or is an official ORU document in which the team cannot verify how AI was used.

#### README.md
- README format was outlined separately by two different members
- The two outlines were expanded on and formatted into separate markdown filesby ChatGPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5
- The created .mds were merged using Claude, then individually modified by the two members to fix any hallucinated information




## agent-info USAGE

#### prompt.txt
- Layout structured by a team member
- All instrustions were enhanced using ChatGPT-5
- Went back and forth with ChatGPT-5 to reduce the character count to fit Copilot Studio's character limit


### knowledge-base

#### Crisis Protocol.xlsx
- Generated with Claude Sonnet 4.5, but not used

#### Department Directory.xlsx
- Data manually collected by a team member
- Services Provided column generated by ChatGPT-5

#### Department Personnel.xlsx
- Converted ORU Contact Sheet HTML to Excel using Claude Sonnet 4.5
- Manually formatted for Agent use by a team member

#### ORU Site Links.xlsx
- Collected and formatted by Perplexity Comet browser extension
- Manually verified by 2 of the team members

#### Quest Event Information File.txt
- Generated by Claude Sonnet given ORU's Quest information

#### petition-info/ORU Petition Context.xlsx
- Used ChatGPT-5 to generate distinct descriptions for each petition type, as well as keywords to help the agent parse through them.


### topics
NOTE: all the topics were worked on using the visual editor, so other than in `ORU Program Info`, `Escalate`, and `Fallback`, no other AI was used to help build the **processing logic**. 

#### Academic Calendar.yaml
- Description made by team then enhanced using ChatGPT-5

#### Admissions.yaml

## evaluation-sets USAGE

All 4 evaluation sets were created by a team member, using a combination of these 3 types of questions
- General questions the team member could come up with
- Frequently Asked college questions, tailored towards ORU
- Generated questions from Microsoft Copilot



## openbible-scraper USAGE

#### keywords.csv
- Topics provided by one team member, who used ChatGPT to expand on the initial 30 topic list
- Topics were then verified by the team member manually on OpenBible.info
- Keywords generated by ChatGPT-5
- Formatting done by authors of `openbiblescraper.py`

#### openbiblescraper.py
- Code structure outlined by authors
- Used Claude Sonnet 4.5 to help determine which libraries to import and setup the header to allow for scraping
- Additionally used claude to determine how to collect the metadata from the OpenBible html
- All parsing, formatting and method dependencies were done by the authors, as well as initializing and saving the data
- Debugging was done by one team member, aided by Claude Sonnet 4.5
